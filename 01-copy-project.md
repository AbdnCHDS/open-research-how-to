## Step 1: Copy this project to your own account

To get started, "fork" this repository to your personal account: click on the "fork" button near the top right. This will create a copy of the repository that belongs to you, and you can modify it in any way you like.

Next, "clone" the repository to your local computer. This creates a copy of the project on your local computer. For this you can use any application that can interact with GitHub (for example you can do it via [RStudio](https://happygitwithr.com/rstudio-git-github.html)), but one of the easiest is [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/). The steps for cloning the repository via GitHub Desktop are described [here](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-and-collaborating-using-github-desktop/adding-and-cloning-repositories/cloning-a-repository-from-github-to-github-desktop).

If everything goes well, you should now be able to see the project as a new folder in your chosen location. The project has the recommended folder structure, which you can read about [in the Guidebook](). Not all folders are needed for this simple example, but each folder contains a "readme" file that explains what it should contain.

Our primary research data in this case is fake, they are in the files population_demographics.csv and hospital_admissions.xlsx. The data is also missing its data documentation, which should be in [this format](https://github.com/AbdnCHDS/DataDocumentationTemplate).

You are now ready for [step 2: creating an RStudio project](02-rstudio-project.md).
