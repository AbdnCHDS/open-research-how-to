## Step 3: Add collaborators and tasks

Adding collaborators to your project enables them to look through and review your work. This is a core aspect of team science: no one works alone! It is important to share and discuss your work, especially computer code, where it is easy to make mistakes. Reviewing each other's work early and often makes it more likely we'll find and correct our mistakes :smiley:

Here are the [steps for adding collaborators to your repository](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-user-account/managing-access-to-your-personal-repositories/inviting-collaborators-to-a-personal-repository).

If you are working through this guide with a friend, you can be each other's collaborators. If you are not sure whom to invite, ask [Dimitra](https://github.com/dblana) (GitHub username: dblana), she is always happy to help!

Next, enable issues in your repository: under your repository name, go to Settings, scroll down to "Features" and tick "Issues". You will now be able to see Issues as another tab under your repository name.

Issues enable you to organise your work into tasks. You can think of your list of issues as your to-do list. To [create a new issue](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/creating-an-issue), go to "Issues" and click on "New issue".

For this example project, we will just create two issues:

- Issue 1: Clean data

Description: Read in the two datasets, inspect them, correct errors, deal with missing data, save processed datasets

- Issue 2: Analyse data

Description: Join the two datasets, manipulate the data as needed to address our aim, create visualisation(s)

Well done! You are now ready to start using R, with help from your collaborators who will review your code.
