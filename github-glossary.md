## GitHub Glossary

One of the most frustrating things about GitHub is the terminology... So here are the most common terms and their meaning:

- Repository (Repo): a project that contains your files, online on GitHub or on your local computer
- Issues: to-do list of tasks you wish to accomplish
- Commit: saving the changes you made to a file or set of files
- Branch: a copy of your project that you can work on without affecting other branches (such as the "main" branch)
- Pull request: request to add your changes from a branch into the main branch
- Merge: act of incorporating new changes (commits) from a branch into main
- Fork: make a copy of someone elseâ€™s repository on GitHub
- Clone: copy a repository from GitHub onto your local computer
- Push: send changes from your local repository to Github
- Pull: take any changes from the GitHub repository and merge them into your local repository
